# Hordeum-Bulbosum-De-Novo-Transcriptome-and-Annotation

You can find the data from our paper XXX in this github repository.
The De Novo transcriptome for H. bulbosum was generated with RNA-seq data using [Trinity](https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq/wiki), and the annotation file was generated with [Trinotate](https://github.com/Trinotate/Trinotate/wiki).


Please refer to our paper for more information on how we conducted the experiment and analyzed the data.
